# Relation Properties Calculator (with Closure)

A simple web-based tool that helps users determine the properties of a relation
— including **reflexive**, **symmetric**, **transitive**, **antisymmetric**, and **closure** computation.

This project is designed for students learning Discrete Mathematics and Computer Science fundamentals.

## 🔧 Features
- Check if a relation is:
  - Reflexive
  - Symmetric
  - Antisymmetric
  - Transitive
- Computes **reflexive closure**
- Computes **symmetric closure**
- Computes **transitive closure**
- Clean HTML, CSS, and JavaScript structure
